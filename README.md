# BI-TJV semester work poletdan

This is my semester work. The project is platform, where people can look at top world films, rate them and leave reviews.
For frontend I used React.js and for backend Java Spring Boot with MySQL.

Have a look at my project, I hope you will enjoy it as I enjoyed it while coded it ;)

## Server

- Go to application.properties and configure your MySQL database information (username, password)

- Run mvn install to install all required packages

```bash
mvn install
```

- Start spring boot appication

## Client
Prerequisites:
- You need to install node.js
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```
- You need to install npm package manager
```bash
sudo apt install npm
```
After installation of node.js and npm package manager
- Go to client folder
```bash
cd client
```
- Run npm install to install all necessary packages
```bash
npm install
```
- Run npm start to start the frontend
```bash
npm start
```

## Go to browser http://localhost:3000/
Now you can check my project - there already should be 5 films ;)
Don't forget to register, because it opens you access to all features ( leave a review, delete review )
